- ⏳ Tag `v1.0.0` release
- ⏳ LinkedIn / portfolio post

**Test gate**: 29 passed, 1 skipped in ~22s (Airflow-load test runs only when `apache-airflow` is installed locally).
**Real-data validation**: 124 team-game rows from 23 distinct game dates (62 games captured), 2026-04-18 → 2026-05-10. Cross-reconciles to ESPN — NYK 8-2 over their last 10 with .630 TS%, OKC perfect 7-0 with .628 TS%, PHX 0-4 swept in round 1.
**Operational milestone**: pipeline has run daily through the 2025–26 NBA playoffs with zero data loss across three+ weeks; one transient `nba_api` blip was auto-recovered via Airflow's retry policy.

## Phase 1 — Core ETL: Ingest → Transform → S3 Write — ✅ shipped
> Goal: Full pipeline runs locally via `python scripts/run_local.py` with real NBA data writing real Parquet to S3 / LocalStack / local disk.

- [x] Scaffold repo structure: dirs, `__init__.py` files, `Makefile`, `.env.example`, `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Write `requirements.txt`: `pyspark==3.5.*`, `nba_api`, `boto3`, `python-dotenv`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`
- [x] Write `requirements-dev.txt`: `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `black`, `ruff`
- [x] Implement `etl/schema.py`: `RAW_BOX_SCORE_SCHEMA`, `PROCESSED_SCHEMA`, `FEATURE_SCHEMA`
- [x] Implement `etl/ingest.py`:
  - [x] `nba_api.stats.endpoints.LeagueGameLog` to list games for a date
  - [x] `BoxScoreTraditionalV2` per game for player rows; sleep 0.6 s between calls (rate-limit guard)
  - [x] Rename `TO` → `tov` (real-`nba_api` regression caught and fixed)
  - [x] Float→int hardening for IntegerType columns (Spark schema mismatch fix)
  - [x] Write raw Parquet to `raw/nba/box_scores/season={Y}/game_date={D}/`
- [x] Implement `etl/transform.py`:
  - [x] `get_spark()` factory function (S3A config gated on non-local mode, `partitionOverwriteMode=dynamic`)
  - [x] `aggregate_team_game(df)` — pts, reb, ast, tov, eFG%, TS%, assist:turnover, win flag, opponent abbreviation, home/away parsing
  - [x] `get_top_player(df, stat_col)` — Window function for top scorer / rebounder / playmaker per team / game
- [x] Implement `etl/write.py`: partitioned by `(season, game_date)` to `processed/` prefix; rejects raw/ paths
- [x] Implement `etl/paths.py`: `LOCAL_OUTPUT_DIR` mode for zero-S3 dev runs
- [x] Implement `scripts/run_local.py`: ingest → transform → write → features, default ingest date = yesterday, dual S3/local destination
- [x] `tests/fixtures/sample_box_scores.csv`: 48 player rows × 4 teams × 2 dates with realistic shot/turnover variance
- [x] `tests/conftest.py`: shared `SparkSession` fixture (`local[2]`), auto-bootstraps `HADOOP_HOME` (Windows winutils.exe) and `PYSPARK_PYTHON`
- [x] `tests/test_ingest.py`: mocks `nba_api`, asserts shape, columns, rate-limit sleep, `tov` regression
- [x] `tests/test_transform.py`: schema match, hand-computed eFG%/TS%, AST/TOV null guard, top-player correctness, home/away parse
- [x] `tests/test_write.py`: partition layout, prefix rejection
- [x] `tests/test_paths.py`: local-mode URI resolution, S3A fallback
- [x] Lint + tests pass with zero AWS credentials and zero network access
- [x] Manual smoke test: real-data run for 4/29 playoff slate produces realistic eFG%, TS%, top scorers (Banchero, Cunningham, Mobley, Barrett, Jokić, Doncić)

---

## Phase 2 — Airflow DAG + Docker Compose Orchestration — ✅ shipped
> Goal: Same pipeline runs as a daily Airflow DAG inside Docker, picking up the prior day's games on its own.

- [x] `infra/Dockerfile.airflow`: extends `apache/airflow:2.9.3-python3.11`, installs OpenJDK 17 + project requirements
- [x] `infra/docker-compose.yml`: postgres + airflow-init + webserver + scheduler. **`LocalExecutor`** (no Celery / Redis — simpler stack, same orchestration semantics for our scale)
- [x] Single-build-owner pattern (`airflow-init` owns `build:`, others use `pull_policy: never`) — avoids the parallel image-export race
- [x] `infra/airflow.env.example`: templated stack env, real `airflow.env` gitignored
- [x] Bind-mounted `dags/`, `etl/`, `scripts/`, `out/` so code changes propagate without a rebuild
- [x] `dags/nba_etl_dag.py`:
  - [x] DAG id `nba_etl_pipeline`, `schedule="@daily"`, `catchup=False`, `max_active_runs=1`
  - [x] Five `PythonOperator` tasks: `ingest_raw → transform_and_aggregate → write_processed → write_features → notify_done`
  - [x] All heavy imports (`pyspark`, `nba_api`, `pandas`, `etl.*`) lazy-loaded inside callables
  - [x] `transform_and_aggregate` writes to `staging/run_date={ds}/`, `write_processed` promotes to canonical `processed/` (real staging-promotion pattern)
  - [x] S3/local paths threaded between tasks via XCom
- [x] `tests/test_dag.py`: AST-level guard rails (no heavy module-level imports), all 5 callables present, full Airflow-load smoke (skipped without `apache-airflow`)
- [x] DAG validated end-to-end: autonomous run on unpause ingested 4/30 playoff games and wrote partitioned Parquet — `demo screenshots/dag_screenshot.png`

---

## Phase 3 — Feature Engineering + Rolling Window Stats — ✅ shipped
> Goal: Feature layer writes rolling 10-game aggregations to `features/` prefix, ready for prediction models.

- [x] `etl/features.py`: `build_rolling_features(df, window=10)` using `Window.partitionBy("team_id").orderBy("game_date").rowsBetween(-9, 0)`
- [x] Rolling metrics: `rolling_pts`, `rolling_efg_pct`, `rolling_ts_pct`, `rolling_ast_to_tov`, `rolling_win_pct`, `games_in_window`
- [x] Home/away split: `rolling_pts_home` / `rolling_pts_away` via conditional-average within the same window
- [x] `etl/schema.py`: `FEATURE_SCHEMA` (13 fields)
- [x] `etl/write.py`: `write_features()` partitioned by `season`; rejects raw/ and processed/ prefixes
- [x] `dags/nba_etl_dag.py`: real `_write_features` task replaces Phase 2 stub; reads full processed history, rebuilds features layer end-to-end
- [x] `scripts/run_local.py`: extended with the features step
- [x] `tests/test_features.py`: 7 tests against a hand-computed 12-game BOS sequence + 4-game LAL counter-team. Asserts exact rolling values, partial-window edges, partitioning, validation, prefix rejection
- [x] **Bonus fix**: `spark.sql.sources.partitionOverwriteMode=dynamic` in `get_spark()` — without this, daily backfills clobber the whole `processed/` prefix instead of touching just the day's partition
- [x] Real-data validation: 14-day Airflow backfill (4/19 → 5/2), then patched 4/18 single-day backfill after spotting the NYK series-record discrepancy. Final state: 92 rows, NYK reconciles to 4-2 — `demo screenshots/backfill_success.png`, `demo screenshots/thru5_3_26_leaderboard.png`
- [x] README updated with feature layer schema and demo screenshots

## Phase 4 — Cloud Deploy: EC2 + S3 + IAM Hardening — ⏳ optional
> Goal: Pipeline runs on real AWS infrastructure with proper IAM, no hardcoded credentials anywhere.
>
> Note: the code already supports real S3 today via the same `S3_BUCKET` / AWS env vars. Phase 4 is purely about provisioning + screenshotting "it ran in the cloud". Skippable for portfolio purposes — most reviewers value the architecture proof in Phases 1-3 over a literal AWS console screenshot.

- [ ] Create IAM policy JSON (`infra/iam_policy.json`): S3 `GetObject`, `PutObject`, `ListBucket` on target bucket only
- [ ] Create IAM role for EC2 instance profile (documented in `infra/README_infra.md`)
- [ ] Provision EC2 instance (t3.medium+) with bootstrap script: Java 17, Python 3.11, Docker, repo clone
- [ ] Write `scripts/bootstrap.sh`: idempotent EC2 install script
- [ ] Configure Airflow on EC2 with `LocalExecutor` + postgres RDS or SQLite (documented trade-off)
- [ ] Test: run `nba_etl_pipeline` DAG on EC2, files land in real S3 bucket
- [ ] Verify: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are **not** in any file on the instance
- [ ] Add S3 bucket policy blocking public access
- [ ] CloudWatch log group for Airflow task logs (optional, documented)
- [ ] Cost estimate: document expected AWS monthly spend at daily cadence in README

---

## Phase 5 — Docs, CI, Demo, Ship It — ✅ mostly shipped
> Goal: Repo is portfolio-ready, discoverable, and demo-able without running any code.

- [x] **Top-of-README rewrite** (`1cb1438`): 60-second elevator pitch — tagline, demo screenshot, What/Why/How/For-Whom block, Skills Demonstrated table with file refs.
- [x] **GitHub Actions CI** (`eb71ac2`): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pytest` + `ruff` + `black --check` + Docker image build on every push to `main`. Green "CI passing" badge in README.
- [x] **Skills demonstrated table** (`1cb1438`): embedded in README rather than its own file. 12-row table mapping competencies to clickable file references.
- [x] **Mermaid architecture diagram** (`011c7c3`, `883ced5`): renders natively on GitHub, shows data flow + DAG + zones in one TD layout.
- [x] **`docs/PROJECT_QA.md`** (`b379be4`): technical + layman Q&A reference, six questions + tiered pitches (30 sec / 2 min / 30 min).
- [x] **`docs/PORTFOLIO_ANECDOTES.md`** (`62f5dd2`, `d728aab`): seven interview-ready stories with headline / when / what / demonstrates / where-to-look format.
- [x] **`scripts/catch_up.ps1`** (`812ba6c`, `545fd3c`, `62f5dd2`): self-healing daily catch-up with `-CleanStale` flag for stuck-DagRun recovery.
- [x] **Streamlit dashboard** (`ff0e222`, polish `e70c0c2`): four views (Leaderboard, Team detail, Head-to-head, Data explorer) reading live pipeline output.
- [x] **Results & Metrics** section in README (`1ba21a1`): concrete numbers from the validation run + top-of-leaderboard table.

Phase 5 leftovers (not blocking; do as energy allows):

- [ ] **`docs/architecture.md`**: longer-form architecture writeup — what's in the README is already sufficient for most readers, this would only matter if someone really wants depth
- [ ] **`docs/data_dictionary.md`**: field-by-field column docs with example values
- [ ] **`docs/runbook.md`**: operational playbook (how to re-trigger a single date, debug a failed task, switch destinations)
- [ ] **`notebooks/exploratory_eda.ipynb`**: pandas read + matplotlib chart of rolling TS% trajectory for the top 4 contenders. Visual storytelling that complements Streamlit (static, embedded in repo for browse-without-running).
- [ ] **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: how to add a new data source (NFL, MLB) following the ingest → transform → write pattern
- [ ] **Tag `v1.0.0` release** on GitHub once any of the above ship that you want as the "v1 line"
- [ ] **LinkedIn / portfolio post** with the leaderboard screenshot, the DAG graph, and one observation from the data

## Backlog / future ideas (not phased, just parked)

### Phase 4b — Prediction model (the project's stated raison d'être)

The features layer was built to feed a downstream prediction model. Closing the
loop is what turns this from "I built a feature store" into "I built a feature
store and the model that consumes it." Bigger lift than a single session
(weekend-scale), so parking until ready.

- [ ] `models/spread_predictor.py` — read `features/`, join to actual game
  outcomes (winner, point margin, total points), train an xgboost or
  sklearn regressor
- [ ] Time-series cross-validation (train on weeks 1–2, test on week 3, etc.)
  to avoid leaking future games into training
- [ ] **MLflow** experiment tracking so model versions and metrics are
  reproducible and portfolio-visible
- [ ] New `streamlit_app.py` view: "Tomorrow's predictions" — model output
  for upcoming games with the rolling features that drove each prediction
- [ ] Optional `notebooks/model_eval.ipynb` — calibration plot, feature
  importance chart, error analysis by team / situation

### Streamlit Cloud public deployment (deferred)

The local-run model (`streamlit run streamlit_app.py`, screen-share in
meetings) is genuinely fine for the current "personal dev + occasional show
during calls" use case. Deferred until: (a) repo goes public, AND
(b) a snapshot of `out/processed/` + `out/features/` is bundled into the
repo so the cloud-hosted app has data to render, OR (c) we hook the
dashboard up to a real S3 bucket with daily writes.

### Other parked ideas

- LocalStack integration test that runs the DAG end-to-end against a fake S3 (`pytest -m integration`) — proves the S3A code path works without a real AWS account
- Switch raw layer from `BoxScoreTraditionalV2` to `BoxScoreAdvancedV2` for additional advanced metrics (offensive rating, defensive rating, pace) → more model-ready features
- Player-level rolling features (next to team-level): trailing pts/reb/ast per player for usage / minutes models
- Add a `season_over_season_delta` feature column: team's current rolling EPA-equivalent vs same week prior season — useful for survivor / spread models
- Schema migration story: how to evolve `PROCESSED_SCHEMA` without breaking existing partitioned reads (Iceberg or Delta Lake substitution)
